277: About / Help
278: OwnSafe is an open source password manager. It can be used both in the browser and as a smartphone app (ANDROID). All the encryption/decryption of the data records is handled on client side so that all entries are always transmitted encrypted over the internet.
279: Security
280: The key for encryption/decryption is never stored on the system. It is generated every time anew directly from your credentials and is only available in browser as long as your are logged in. The encryption/decryption is handled on client side (browser) all the time and the entries are sent always encrypted over the internet. Anyway it is strongly recommended to use a HTTPS connection, because while the login process your credentials (digest value of the password) are send to the server. While changing login data all entries will be loaded, enrcypted with a new generated key and stored again. In case of a disruption risk of data loss occurs. On instable connection it is recommended to export the entries temporarily in advance this procedure.
281: Copy function
282: Don't forget to clean the clipboard after you have copied some entries. You will be reminded to do this after logout.
283: Logout
284: For security reasons it is recommended to close the browser after logout. Don't forget to clean the clipboard after you have copied some entries. You will be reminded to do this after logout.
285: Forgot password
286: There is no 'forgot password' button available because the password is never stored on the system. Enter a password hint to you profile and it will be send to your email address if you cannot remember your password. It will be sent to you via e-mail. Don't enter the password here. 
287: E-Mail notifications
288: It is recommended to add your email address to your profile. You will be informed about failed login attempts and if you have forgot your password a password hint can be send to this email address (if you have added a password hint your profile). For sending an email the server you are running this application on must be properly configured (you must be able to send an email by sendmail on your server alternatively check the "Path to sendmail" parameter on phpinfo).
